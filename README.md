Simple Spaghetti Spring boot RESTful Webservice to Handle a Merge queue in Hipchat.

As basically as I can put it, we have a global Queue of Strings in memory, and we can add / remove or query Strings and send a message back to Hipchat.

TODO - Write here a sample of the input JSON and the expected Message result.
